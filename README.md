# Patience Anipa - Data Analyst Portfolio


## About Me

Hi, I am Patience! This is a repository I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science related topics.
However, before I delve into the contents of this portfolio, I would like to introduce myself and my inspiration to begin my journey in this field.

I have an analytical background in Actuarial Science and currently, I am on track to completing my masters degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Analytics and Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in the analysis and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, get updated on trends in data analysis and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
