# Patience Anipa - Data Analyst Portfolio


## About Me

Hi, I am Patience! This is a repository that I created to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science-related topics.
However, before delving into the contents of this portfolio, I would like to introduce myself and explain why I decided to pursue a career in this field.

I have an analytical background in Actuarial Science, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Analytics and Data Science. I have a solid understanding of data analysis and a strong desire to use data to uncover meaningful insights. As an entry-level data analyst, I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in the field of data science.

Throughout my studies, I improved my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for detecting patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be useful in my future role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, update myself on current trends in data analysis and always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. 


## About The Projects

The projects in this repository are a combination of personal projects I have done to advance my knowledge and improve my skills with various programming languages, and projects on specific topics which are the conerstone of many data analysis applications. I have done some of these projects as part of my masters studies at Aalto University.

## Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

In this section I list the data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve the cases.

### Movie Industry Performance Correlation Analysis
**Code:** [``]()

**Dataset:** [``]()

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between movie features and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.


### Analysis of Bike Store Sales
**Code:** [`Bike Store Sales Data Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Bike%20Store%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Dataset:** [`Excel Bike Sales Project Dataset.xlsx`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Excel%20Bike%20Sales%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of a bike store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and analyzing sales data.

**Skills:** Numerical Analysis, Data wrangling, Categorical analysis, Data visualization, Selection and sorting, Data analysis

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy
