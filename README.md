# Patience Anipa - Data Analyst Portfolio


## About Me

Hi, I am Patience! This is a repository that I created to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science-related topics.
However, before delving into the contents of this portfolio, I would like to introduce myself and explain why I decided to pursue a career in this field.

I have an analytical background in Actuarial Science, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Analytics and Data Science. I have a solid understanding of data analysis and a strong desire to use data to uncover meaningful insights. As an entry-level data analyst, I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in the field of data science.

Throughout my studies, I improved my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for detecting patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be useful in my future role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, update myself on current trends in data analysis and always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. 


## About The Projects

The projects in this repository are a combination of personal projects I have done to advance my knowledge and improve my skills with various programming languages, and projects on specific topics which are the conerstone of many data analysis applications. I have done some of these projects as part of my masters studies at Aalto University.

# Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

In this section I list the data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve the cases.

## Movie Industry Performance Correlation Analysis
**Code:** [`Movie Industry Performance Correlation Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Movie%20Industry%20Performance%20Correlation%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Dataset:** [`movies.csv`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/movies.csv)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between movie features and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization

**Technology stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** The analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings of movies. The ideal runtime of the movies was between 160 and 190 minutes. Also, the action and animation genres of movies produced tended to be more successful than other genres. 


## Google Stock Market Analysis
**Code:** [`Google Stock Market Analysis.html`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Google%20Stock%20Market%20Analysis.html)

**Dataset:** The stock price data of Google was downloaded using the Yahoo Finance API.

**Goal:** To analyze the stock market interactively using the Python programming language.

**Description:** Stock Market Analysis refers to analyzing the current and historical trends in the stock market to make future buying and selling decisions. The analysis done in this notebook serves this purpose using valuable visualization tools such as candlestick charts, line charts, bar plots and rangesliders.

**Skills:** stock price data analysis, trend analysis, data visualization, interactive plots

**Dataset:** [`Stress Data.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/stress.csv)

**Goal:** To build a trained model which detects whether a person is stressed.

**Description:** The model is trained using data posted on 'subreddits' related to mental health. This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. The data is first cleaned from words with no meaning or unnecessary characters. The data is then split into a training set and a testing set and finally trained using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm.

**Skills:** Natural Language Processing, Data training, Data cleaning, Data visualization

**Technology stack:** Python, scikit-learn, nltk, re, pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib



### Apple Stock Price Prediction
 
      
## Multivariate Statistical Data Analysis in R

### Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in multivariate statistical analysis. Its primary purpose is to transform a set of correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components. These principal components capture the most significant variance in the data. The projects below showcase some applications of PCA in various contexts.
