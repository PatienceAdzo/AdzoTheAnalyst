# Patience Anipa - Data Analyst Portfolio


## About Me

Hi, I am Patience! This is a repository that I created to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science-related topics.
However, before delving into the contents of this portfolio, I would like to introduce myself and explain why I decided to pursue a career in this field.

I have an analytical background in Actuarial Science, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Analytics and Data Science. I have a solid understanding of data analysis and a strong desire to use data to uncover meaningful insights. As an entry-level data analyst, I am excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in the field of data science.

Throughout my studies, I improved my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for detecting patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be useful in my future role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, update myself on current trends in data analysis and always look for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. 


## About The Projects

The projects in this repository are a combination of personal projects I have done to advance my knowledge and improve my skills with various programming languages, and projects on specific topics which are the conerstone of many data analysis applications. I have done some of these projects as part of my masters studies at Aalto University.

## Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

In this section I list the data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve the cases.

### Analysis of Bike Sales Data
**Code:** [`Bike Store Sales Data Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Bike%20Store%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Data:** [`Excel Bike Sales Project Dataset.xlsx`](https://github.com/PatienceAdzo/AdzoTheAnalyst/blob/main/Excel%20Bike%20Sales%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

**Goal:** To get hands-on experience for analysing data in Python.

**Description:** This project contains various sections where bike sales data is analysed using various techniques. The objective was to get some practice in analysing data.

**Skills:** Numerical Analysis, Data wrangling, Categorical analysis, Data visualization, Selection and sorting, Data analysis

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy
